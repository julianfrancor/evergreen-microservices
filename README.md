# EverGreen Platform Management Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on developing an application for managing the EverGreen company's platform. EverGreen specializes in managing AgroChains through advanced technologies such as IoT, Artificial Intelligence, Drones, and Sensors.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

In this project, we apply the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach to structure the system's architecture. DDD focuses on understanding and solving complex business domain problems, allowing us to make informed design decisions and create software that effectively aligns with the company's objectives.

## Microservices

The architecture of this project is based on the microservices paradigm. Each component, such as the user service, roles, and modules, is implemented as an independent microservice. This promotes modularity, scalability, and enables agile development and deployment.

## Course: Advanced Software Architectures

This project is developed as part of the "Advanced Software Architectures" course. The aim is to acquire the necessary tools and knowledge to design and develop high-complexity software systems.

## Domain Entities

We have identified three key domain entities for this project:

1. **User:** Represents the users who interact with the EverGreen platform. Each user has roles and can access different modules.

2. **Module:** Refers to the specific functionalities and features that make up the platform. Each module has different associated access permissions.

3. **Role:** Defines the user roles or profiles, determining what actions they can perform and which modules they have access to.

These entities form the basis of the business logic and guide the structure and functionalities of our application.
